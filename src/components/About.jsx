      <p>Software engineer with a demonstrated mindset for clean, modular code in order to achieve scalability and optimization. I work with Javascript, React.js, Express.js, CSS3, Postgres, MySQL, MondoDB, AWS, and NGINX to create full-stack applications. I'm currently developing a web application that helps guitarists improve their fretboard navigation abilities. I started programming by teaching myself C# for game development, and eventually migrated to Godot and its native language, GDscript.</p>
