    <div>About</div>
      <p>I'm a software engineer, music instructor, and audio engineer.
        I'm currently working on developing a web application that help
        guitarists improve their musical navigation abilities.
        I started programming as a hobby, teaching myself C# for Unity,
        and eventually migrating to Godot and its native language, GDscript.
        I soon decided to pursue programming as a career. I now work with
        Javascript, React.js, Express, and other related technologies to
        create full-stack applications.</p>
